# distribution-network-model
There are 2 csv files, nodes.csv and edges.csv 

The nodes.csv correspond to the the location of each of the import centers, distribution centers and retail stores. 
The edges.csv correspond to the edges that connect all the nodes and carries the information about the cost and capacity on each of the edges.

These files can be edited with required information or other data.

The code will output a network graph as an html file in the same directory.
